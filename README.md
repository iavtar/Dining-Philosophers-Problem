# Dining Philosophers Problem Simulation

Multithreaded Solution using Java

## Problem Statement

### The problem is formulated by Dijkstra in 1965

5 Philosophers are present at a table and there are 5 forks (chopsticks)

The philosopher can eat and think

Philosophers can eat when they have both left and right chopsticks

A chopstick can be hold by one philosopher at a given time

## The Problem: how to create a concurrent algorithm such that no philosopher will starve? (The AIM is to avoid deadlock)
